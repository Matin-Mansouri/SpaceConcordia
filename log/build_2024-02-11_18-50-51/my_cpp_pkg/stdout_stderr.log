[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findeclcpp.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "eclcpp", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "eclcpp" with any
  of the following names:

    eclcppConfig.cmake
    eclcpp-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "eclcpp" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "eclcpp_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "eclcpp"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
