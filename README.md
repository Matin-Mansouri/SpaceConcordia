# Welcome to Space Concordia Intro Task

## Introduction
Welcome to the Space Concordia Intro Task repository! This repository contains the introductory task for Space Concordia.

## About the Task
- Install Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. You can install your preferred distro, but be prepared to
spend some time getting it to work, as it might not be supported, or fully
compatible with our codebase. A Virtual Machine is acceptable, but not
recommended for autonomy, as it will become very resource intensive.
- Install ROS Humble on your fresh linux installation
- Go over the tutorials here. The “beginner level” is more than you will need.
- Using what you learned in the tutorials, create a C++ and a Python node that
communicate with each other using the ROS library.
- For your code, create a repository on github/gitlab and use the version control
features. We want to see a commit history. Finally, once you are done, share
your repository with us (emails at the bottom of the document).

## How to use my files
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Matin-Mansouri/SpaceConcordia.git
```
After cloning, navigate to the ros2_ws folder. In this folder, you can find my Python and C++ packages. Each package contains a publisher and subscriber node located in the src folder. Here are the details:

Publisher: Robot_news_station
Subscriber: Smartphone
